Overview of some public Python libraries

This is a tour of the few python libraries I am using to help automate online form submissions for internal use at my company.

The first library I will dive into is a Package for editing PDF files, it is called FPDF. Its main purpose that I have devoted it to is to placing information on some internal forms that we want automated. Obviously, I cannot have the forms in this folder so most of its preview will be put onto a new PDF stored in a file path that will be declared in the file.

The Next library I will dive into is a basic SMTP library included with new versions of Python. Obviously, it will be used to automatically send emails to predetermined addresses.
