Overview of some public Python libraries

This is a tour of the few python libraries I am using to help automate online form submissions for internal use at my company.

The first library I will dive into is a Package for editing PDF files, it is called FPDF. Its main purpose that I have devoted it to is to placing information on some internal forms that we want automated. Obviously, I cannot have the forms in this folder so most of its preview will be put onto a new PDF stored in a file path that will be declared in the file.

The Next library I will dive into is a basic SMTP library included with new versions of Python. Obviously, it will be used to automatically send emails to predetermined addresses. Like our next package, this wont function without a prerequisite of allowing Less Secure Apps access to your google email account.

Lastly we look at the package known as GSpread, used for getting information from a google spreadsheet. As I mention in the code, you will not be able to use the script prior to setting up a service account with google and getting a JSON file from there.

Obviously this is a very torn down version of what I am building and have built, but it shows all the resources we are using to automate online forms to be outputted into a specific PDF format. Thank you for looking through my work and projects, if you'd like a full .py file I can certainly provide one to allow you a deeper insight into how it functions. Feel free to contact me with any questions, thanks again and have a good christmas time (or insert season)!
